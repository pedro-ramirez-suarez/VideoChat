# VideoChat

<p>A video chat with HTML5 + javascript + Server Sent Events</p>

<p>Created with Asp.Net MVC 5 and <a href="https://github.com/pedro-ramirez-suarez/needletailtools/wiki/Using-Needletail.Mvc" target="_blank">Needletail.MVC</a> to facilitate SSE</p>

The application supports only two users, but with minor changes it can support many more.

Using the following open source projects:
- Recorder.js
- Bootstap
- JQuery

<b>Important </b> SSE is not supported on Internet Explorer(any version), also, for some reason SSE does not work fine on IIS Express, so use normal IIS instead.
